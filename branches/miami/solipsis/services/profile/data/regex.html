    <h3>Default searching mode</h3>
    <p>
      Anyword entered in the searching fields will act as a key word
      and will be seek through neighbours' data. Filters are
      insensitive to case.
    </p>

    <h3>Advanced searching mode (files only, coming soon)</h3>

    <p>
      The keyword entered is not searched through, it is matched
      exactly. This means that <code>"photo"</code> will not give you
      any result for a picture named <code>"my best photo
      ever.jpg"</code>, not even <code>"photo.jpg"</code>. For those,
      you will have to use wildchars...
    </p>

    <p>
      The character <code>'*'</code> is available as a wildchar (a
      joker) to ease and extend filtering results.
    </p>

    <p>
      For instance the filter <code>"*.jpg"</code> matching anyfile
      with the extension<code>".jpg"</code>. And
      <code>"*forest*.jpg"</code> would match any file containing
      <code>"forest"</code> in its title and with the extension
      <code>".jpg"</code>

    </p>

    <h3>Expert searching mode (files only, coming soon)</h3>
    <p>
      This mode uses regular expressions to perform the search. It
      uses a set of wildchars to describe the format of the searched
      value, or the number of its occurences:
    <br>
      . ^ $ * + ? { [ ] \ | ( )
    </p>
    <p>
      It also provides a set of expression describing the expected
    format:
    <br>

      \d \D \s \S \w \W
    </p>
