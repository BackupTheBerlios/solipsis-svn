Solipsis (0.9.1)

  * Changes in Profile (v 0.2.1)
  ==============================

	+ Reviewed ergonomy of GUI:
	---------------------------

	Merge of the Personal and Custom tabs which result in a clearer
	and more concise set of data

	The Contact tab has been removed for now but will reappear soon in
	one form or another

	The menu has been clarified (purified) too.

	+ Reviewed saving & loading system:
	-----------------------------------

	Profiles are now loaded according to the identity used when
	connecting to solipsis. This identity defines the pseudo of the
	profile and the name of the file where to save data.

	A popup prompts the user to save its modification if any.

	+ Bug fixes
	-----------

	Ip addresses were not set up correctly which resulted in problems
	of file transfer.

	Paths from windows read on Linux were not rightly interpreted,
	wich also resulted on impossibility of file transfer.
