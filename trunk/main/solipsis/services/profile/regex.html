Simple Patterns</a>
</h1>

<p>
We'll start by learning about the simplest possible regular
expressions.  Since regular expressions are used to operate on
strings, we'll begin with the most common task: matching characters.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION000310000000000000000">
1 Matching Characters</a>
</h2>

<p>
Most letters and characters will simply match themselves.  For
example, the regular expression <tt class="regexp">test</tt> will match the string
"<tt class="samp">test</tt>" exactly.  (You can enable a case-insensitive mode that
would let this RE match "<tt class="samp">Test</tt>" or "<tt class="samp">TEST</tt>" as well; more
about this later.)  

</p><p>
There are exceptions to this rule; some characters are
special, and don't match themselves.  Instead, they signal that some
out-of-the-ordinary thing should be matched, or they affect other
portions of the RE by repeating them.  Much of this document is
devoted to discussing various metacharacters and what they do.

</p><p>
Here's a complete list of the metacharacters; their meanings will be
discussed in the rest of this HOWTO.

</p><p>
</p><div class="verbatim"><pre>. ^ $ * + ? { [ ] \ | ( )
</pre></div>

<p>
The first metacharacters we'll look at are "<tt class="samp">[</tt>" and "<tt class="samp">]</tt>".
They're used for specifying a character class, which is a set of
characters that you wish to match.  Characters can be listed
individually, or a range of characters can be indicated by giving two
characters and separating them by a "<tt class="character">-</tt>".  For example,
<tt class="regexp">[abc]</tt> will match any of the characters "<tt class="samp">a</tt>", "<tt class="samp">b</tt>", or
"<tt class="samp">c</tt>"; this is the same as
<tt class="regexp">[a-c]</tt>, which uses a range to express the same set of
characters.  If you wanted to match only lowercase letters, your
RE would be <tt class="regexp">[a-z]</tt>.

</p><p>
Metacharacters are not active inside classes.  For example,
<tt class="regexp">[akm$]</tt> will match any of the characters "<tt class="character">a</tt>",
"<tt class="character">k</tt>", "<tt class="character">m</tt>", or "<tt class="character">$</tt>"; "<tt class="character">$</tt>" is
usually a metacharacter, but inside a character class it's stripped of
its special nature.

</p><p>
You can match the characters not within a range by <i class="dfn">complementing</i>
the set.  This is indicated by including a "<tt class="character">^</tt>" as the first
character of the class; "<tt class="character">^</tt>" elsewhere will simply match the
"<tt class="character">^</tt>" character.  For example, <code>[^5]</code> will match any
character except "<tt class="character">5</tt>".

</p><p>
Perhaps the most important metacharacter is the backslash, "<tt class="samp">\</tt>".  
As in Python string literals, the backslash can be followed by various
characters to signal various special sequences.  It's also used to escape
all the metacharacters so you can still match them in patterns; for
example, if you need to match a "<tt class="samp">[</tt>" or 
"<tt class="samp">\</tt>", you can precede them with a backslash to remove their
special meaning: <tt class="regexp">\[</tt> or <tt class="regexp">\\</tt>.

</p><p>
Some of the special sequences beginning with "<tt class="character">\</tt>" represent
predefined sets of characters that are often useful, such as the set
of digits, the set of letters, or the set of anything that isn't
whitespace.  The following predefined special sequences are available:

</p><p>
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>\d</code></dt>
<dd>Matches any decimal digit; this is
equivalent to the class <tt class="regexp">[0-9]</tt>.

<p>

</p></dd><dt><code>\D</code></dt>
<dd>Matches any non-digit character; this is
equivalent to the class <code>[^0-9]</code>.

<p>

</p></dd><dt><code>\s</code></dt>
<dd>Matches any whitespace character; this is
equivalent to the class <tt class="regexp">[ \t\n\r\f\v]</tt>.

<p>

</p></dd><dt><code>\S</code></dt>
<dd>Matches any non-whitespace character; this is
equivalent to the class <code>[^ \t\n\r\f\v]</code>.

<p>

</p></dd><dt><code>\w</code></dt>
<dd>Matches any alphanumeric character; this is equivalent to the class
<tt class="regexp">[a-zA-Z0-9_]</tt>.  

<p>

</p></dd><dt><code>\W</code></dt>
<dd>Matches any non-alphanumeric character; this is equivalent to the class
<code>[^a-zA-Z0-9_]</code>.   
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
These sequences can be included inside a character class.  For
example, <tt class="regexp">[\s,.]</tt> is a character class that will match any
whitespace character, or "<tt class="character">,</tt>" or "<tt class="character">.</tt>".

</p><p>
The final metacharacter in this section is <tt class="regexp">.</tt>.  It matches
anything except a newline character, and there's an alternate mode
(<code>re.DOTALL</code>) where it will match even a newline.  "<tt class="character">.</tt>"
is often used where you want to match ``any character''.  

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION000320000000000000000">
2 Repeating Things</a>
</h2>

<p>
Being able to match varying sets of characters is the first thing
regular expressions can do that isn't already possible with the
methods available on strings.  However, if that was the only
additional capability of regexes, they wouldn't be much of an advance.
Another capability is that you can specify that portions of the RE
must be repeated a certain number of times.

</p><p>
The first metacharacter for repeating things that we'll look at is
<tt class="regexp">*</tt>.  <tt class="regexp">*</tt> doesn't match the literal character "<tt class="samp">*</tt>";
instead, it specifies that the previous character can be matched zero
or more times, instead of exactly once.

</p><p>
For example, <tt class="regexp">ca*t</tt> will match "<tt class="samp">ct</tt>" (0 "<tt class="samp">a</tt>"characters), "<tt class="samp">cat</tt>" (1 "<tt class="samp">a</tt>"), "<tt class="samp">caaat</tt>" (3 "<tt class="samp">a</tt>"characters), and so forth.  The RE engine has various internal
limitations stemming from the size of C's <code>int</code> type, that will
prevent it from matching over 2 billion "<tt class="samp">a</tt>" characters; you
probably don't have enough memory to construct a string that large, so
you shouldn't run into that limit.

</p><p>
Repetitions such as <tt class="regexp">*</tt> are <i class="dfn">greedy</i>; when repeating a RE,
the matching engine will try to repeat it as many times as possible.
If later portions of the pattern don't match, the matching engine will
then back up and try again with few repetitions.

</p><p>
A step-by-step example will make this more obvious.  Let's consider
the expression <tt class="regexp">a[bcd]*b</tt>.  This matches the letter
"<tt class="character">a</tt>", zero or more letters from the class <code>[bcd]</code>, and
finally ends with a "<tt class="character">b</tt>".  Now imagine matching this RE
against the string "<tt class="samp">abcbd</tt>".  

</p><p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse;" align="center" border="1">
  <thead>
    <tr class="tableheader">
      <th align="center"><b>Step</b>&nbsp;</th>
      <th align="left"><b>Matched</b>&nbsp;</th>
      <th align="left"><b>Explanation</b>&nbsp;</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
  <tbody valign="baseline">
    <tr><td align="center" valign="baseline">1</td>
        <td align="left"><code>a</code></td>
        <td align="left">The <tt class="regexp">a</tt> in the RE matches.</td>
    </tr><tr><td align="center" valign="baseline">2</td>
        <td align="left"><code>abcbd</code></td>
        <td align="left">The engine matches <tt class="regexp">[bcd]*</tt>, going as far as
it can, which is to the end of the string.</td>
    </tr><tr><td align="center" valign="baseline">3</td>
        <td align="left"><i>Failure</i></td>
        <td align="left">The engine tries to match <tt class="regexp">b</tt>, but the
current position is at the end of the string, so it fails.</td>
    </tr><tr><td align="center" valign="baseline">4</td>
        <td align="left"><code>abcb</code></td>
        <td align="left">Back up, so that  <tt class="regexp">[bcd]*</tt> matches
one less character.</td>
    </tr><tr><td align="center" valign="baseline">5</td>
        <td align="left"><i>Failure</i></td>
        <td align="left">Try <tt class="regexp">b</tt> again, but the
current position is at the last character, which is a "<tt class="character">d</tt>".</td>
    </tr><tr><td align="center" valign="baseline">6</td>
        <td align="left"><code>abc</code></td>
        <td align="left">Back up again, so that  <tt class="regexp">[bcd]*</tt> is
only matching "<tt class="samp">bc</tt>".</td>
    </tr><tr><td align="center" valign="baseline">6</td>
        <td align="left"><code>abcb</code></td>
        <td align="left">Try <tt class="regexp">b</tt> again.  This time 
but the character at the current position is "<tt class="character">b</tt>", so it succeeds.</td></tr></tbody>
</table>

</p><p>
The end of the RE has now been reached, and it has matched
"<tt class="samp">abcb</tt>".  This demonstrates how the matching engine goes as far as
it can at first, and if no match is found it will then progressively
back up and retry the rest of the RE again and again.  It will back up
until it has tried zero matches for <tt class="regexp">[bcd]*</tt>, and if that
subsequently fails, the engine will conclude that the string doesn't
match the RE at all.

</p><p>
Another repeating metacharacter is <tt class="regexp">+</tt>, which matches one or
more times.  Pay careful attention to the difference between
<tt class="regexp">*</tt> and <tt class="regexp">+</tt>; <tt class="regexp">*</tt> matches <i>zero</i> or more
times, so whatever's being repeated may not be present at all, while
<tt class="regexp">+</tt> requires at least <i>one</i> occurrence.  To use a similar
example, <tt class="regexp">ca+t</tt> will match "<tt class="samp">cat</tt>" (1 "<tt class="samp">a</tt>"),
"<tt class="samp">caaat</tt>" (3 "<tt class="samp">a</tt>"'s), but won't match "<tt class="samp">ct</tt>".

</p><p>
There are two more repeating qualifiers.  The question mark character,
<tt class="regexp">?</tt>, matches either once or zero times; you can think of it as
marking something as being optional.  For example, <tt class="regexp">home-?brew</tt>
matches either "<tt class="samp">homebrew</tt>" or "<tt class="samp">home-brew</tt>".  

</p><p>
The most complicated repeated qualifier is
<tt class="regexp">{<var>m</var>,<var>n</var>}</tt>, where <var>m</var> and <var>n</var> are decimal
integers.  This qualifier means there must be at least <var>m</var>
repetitions, and at most <var>n</var>.  For example, <tt class="regexp">a/{1,3}b</tt>
will match "<tt class="samp">a/b</tt>", "<tt class="samp">a//b</tt>", and "<tt class="samp">a///b</tt>".  It won't match
"<tt class="samp">ab</tt>", which has no slashes, or "<tt class="samp">a////b</tt>", which has four.

</p><p>
You can omit either <var>m</var> or <var>n</var>; in that case, a reasonable
value is assumed for the missing value.  Omitting <var>m</var> is
interpreted as a lower limit of 0, while omitting <var>n</var> results in  an
upper bound of infinity -- actually, the 2 billion limit mentioned
earlier, but that might as well be infinity.  

</p><p>
Readers of a reductionist bent may notice that the three other qualifiers
can all be expressed using this notation.  <tt class="regexp">{0,}</tt> is the same
as <tt class="regexp">*</tt>, <tt class="regexp">{1,}</tt> is equivalent to <tt class="regexp">+</tt>, and
<tt class="regexp">{0,1}</tt> is the same as <tt class="regexp">?</tt>.  It's better to use
<tt class="regexp">*</tt>, <tt class="regexp">+</tt>, or <tt class="regexp">?</tt> when you can, simply because
they're shorter and easier to read.
