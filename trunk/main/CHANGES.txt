
Solipsis (0.10)
    - profile plugin moved into separate "contrib" directory (not in main
    distrib)
    - recursive preloading of avatars from the "avatar" directory
    - play some sounds on a few events (when a peer appears, or when a chat
    message is received)
    - an option to cycle our avatar through all files of a directory,
    on a periodic basis (a few seconds)
    - some memory consumption fixes in the node (long-running processes
    hosting tens of bots each were quite leaky - I don't know if the problem
    is fully solved yet, but there is quite an improvement)

Solipsis (0.9.6)
    - new profile filter ergonomy + NAT traversal
    - persistent node id

Solipsis (0.9.5)
    - new dynamic entity cache: see details at
    http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/solipsis-tech/2005-September/000168.html
    - differents avatars for nodes which have the avatar plugin
    but do not have a configured avatar (to distinguish them from robots)
    - additional column in bookmark view to display URL
    - bug: we used the public address in some cases when contacting a node
    behind the same NAT as us
    - trial bug fix for timing problems in STUN sequence
    - trial bug fix for unicode path problems
    - trial bug fix for wxPython 2.5 compatibility

Solipsis (0.9.4)
    - new protocol version (1.1): see details at
    http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/solipsis-tech/2005-September/000156.html
    - German translation update and new Spanish translation
    - several bug fixes

Solipsis (0.9.3)
    - much better IP address discovery (thanks to the Shtoom project)
    - try to keep persistent node IDs when launched from the navigator
    - fix behaviour of "jump to position": only jump near the position
    when another peer is already at that exact position
    - improve detection and resolution of position conflicts in the
    state machine
    - various bug fixes and improvements

Solipsis (0.9.1)
    * Changes in Profile (v 0.2.1)
    ==============================

    + Reviewed ergonomy of GUI:
    ---------------------------

    Merge of the Personal and Custom tabs which result in a clearer
    and more concise set of data

    The Contact tab has been removed for now but will reappear soon in
    one form or another

    The menu has been clarified (purified) too.

    + Reviewed saving & loading system:
    -----------------------------------

    Profiles are now loaded according to the identity used when
    connecting to solipsis. This identity defines the pseudo of the
    profile and the name of the file where to save data.

    A popup prompts the user to save its modification if any.

    + Bug fixes
    -----------

    Ip addresses were not set up correctly which resulted in problems
    of file transfer.

    Paths from windows read on Linux were not rightly interpreted,
    wich also resulted on impossibility of file transfer.
